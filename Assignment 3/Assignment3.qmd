\subsection{(i)} \label{q1_1}

The treatment effect in theory is the difference between the outcomes if the individual is treated versus if the individual is not treated. Suppose that for individual $i$, the treatment effect is defined as:

\begin{equation}
TE_i = \Delta_i = y_{i,d=1} - y_{i,d=0},
\end{equation}

\noindent where the $y$ marks the outcome and $d$ is the dummy whether individual $i$ was treated ($d=1$) or not ($d=0$). However, this is rarely possible to be observed for each individual, as treatment is generally considered mutually exclusive, so an individual is either treated or not. Therefore, in this example we cannot calculate TE measures for individuals within color groups, but we can pretend as if one color corresponds to one observation, and calculate the three treatment effects across the color groups.

Then, the treatment effect for "observation" purple is $9 - 7 = 2$, the treatment effect for "observation" blue is $13 - 8 = 5$ and the treatment effect for "observation" green is $10 - 9 = 1$. 

\subsection{(ii)} \label{q1_2}

Using the assumption of \brefsection{q1_1}, we can infer here that we are looking for the average treatment effect of the full population including all colors. The average treatment effect is generally given by:

\begin{equation}
ATE = E[\Delta] = E[y_{d=1} - y_{d=0}],
\end{equation}

\noindent where we take the average across the observation differences. Our data in the exercise does not contain information again on the individual outcomes, however we can use the average outcomes of treatment and control in each color group to calculate the total differences between $y_{d=1}$ and $y_{d=0}$ on the full population. Therefore, we can calculate the ATE as:

```{r}
E_diff_purple = 9 - 7
E_diff_blue = 13 - 8 
E_diff_green = 10 - 9
  
ATE = (E_diff_purple * 200 + E_diff_blue * 100 + E_diff_green * 100) / 400
ATE
```



\subsection{(iii)} \label{q1_3}

Compared to the solution in \brefsection{q1_2}, now we consider the average treatment effect among treated (ATET). For this case, we need to modify the previous definition to:

\begin{equation}
ATET = E[\Delta | d=1] = E[y_{d=1} - y_{d=0} | d=1] = E[y_{d=1}] - E[y_{d=0}] = \frac{1}{N_T} \Sigma^{N_T}_{i=1} y_{i,d=1} - \frac{1}{N_{NT}} \Sigma^{N_{NT}}_{i=1} y_{i,d=0},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N_T$ is the number of individuals in the treatment group while $N_{NT}$ is the number of individuals in the control group. Therefore, the ATET for the whole population can be calculated as:

```{r}
E_treatment_atet <- (9*100 + 13*75 + 10*25) / (100+75+25)
E_control_atet <- (7*100 + 8*25 + 9*75) / (100+75+25)

ATET = E_treatment_atet - E_control_atet
ATET
```

\subsection{(iv)} \label{q1_4}

The ATE measure generally describes the expected gain in $y$ achieved by treating a random member $i$ from the population, i.e. how much one benefits from being selected for the treatment compared to people who were not. On the other hand, ATET describes the average gain achieved by the treatment for the treated group, i.e. the comparison is not to the population but peer-to-peer, what is the expected benefit for those who are selected. The ATET is more helpful if we are not mainly interested in the potentially positive effect of the treatment for those who are treated versus those who are not, but rather the magnitude of these positive effects. Suppose that we have an experiment where the government announces a new plan to introduce an additional level of health insurance, where the own risk cost would be cut in half, in order to investigate the effects of these on household savings. Arguably, cutting the own risk cost in half without changing the insurance monthly premiums would most likely have a positive effect on the wealth for those who are involved in the initial study, but if the government is rather interested in measuring the average savings surplus this would create for households, we would be more interested in the ATET measure as this policy will ideally be introduced for everyone later on and we are solely interested in the average savings surplus this would create for everyone involved.


\section{Question 2}

```{r load data q2, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
# Make sure to delete this before handin, just have it as setting working directory
#setwd("~/GitHub/bds_block3/Econometrics_II/Assignment 3")

dfData = read.csv("bonus.csv")
attach(dfData)

dfData <- na.omit(dfData)
```

\subsection{(i)} \label{q2_1}

```{r}
df_noR <- dfData[dfData$bonus0 == 1,]
df_lowR <- dfData[dfData$bonus500 == 1,]
df_highR <- dfData[dfData$bonus1500 == 1,]

sum_noR <- sapply(df_noR, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
sum_lowR <- sapply(df_lowR, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
sum_highR <- sapply(df_highR, mean, na.rm=TRUE)

summary_table <- cbind(sum_noR, sum_lowR, sum_highR)

kable(summary_table, caption="The means of the predictor and dependent variables across the three groups", col.names = c("no reward", "low reward", "high reward"), digits = 3)
```

As we can see from the summary table above, the no reward group saw a 19.5\% pass rate, the low reward group saw a 20.2\% pass rate while the high reward group saw a 24.1\% pass rate. At the same time, we can also look at the other numeric variables to investigate their means and check how balanced the other predictors are. Naturally since we grouped the students based on the incentives, the three \textit{bonus} variables will not be balanced. However, the other ones are quite similar among the three groups implying that the background characteristics are relatively balanced. In particular, parental educational background (\textit{myeduc} and \textit{fyeduc}) and high-school math scores (\textit{math}) are quite similar to one another among groups.

\subsection{(ii)} \label{q2_2}

```{r}
prob_lm1 <- lm(pass ~ bonus500 + bonus1500, data = dfData)
```
Looking at the summary statistics for the first model, we can see that the effects of the treatments are not statistically significant. Thus, we cannot say whether the treatment effect has an influence on the students' study achievements or not.
```{r}
prob_lm2 <- lm(pass ~ bonus500 + bonus1500 + fyeduc + p0 + math, data = dfData)
summary(prob_lm2)
```
In the second model, we add 3 additional control variables, namely, father's education \textit{fyeduc}, subjective self-assessment of the pass probability \textit{p0}, and highschool math score \textit{math}. However, the significance of the treatment variables \textit{bonus500} and \textit{bonus1500} do not change. Thus, from both of this model, we say that the financial incenntive does not influence student's study performance in the first year.
\subsection{(iii)} \label{q2_3}

```{r}
prob_lm3 <- lm(pass ~ bonus500 + bonus1500 + fyeduc + p0 + math +job +effort, data = dfData)
summary(prob_lm3)
```
In the third model, we include the variable indicating whether a student has a job \textit{job} and the average number of study hours \textit{effort}. 

To comment on this approach, we do not think these two control variables are good addition to the model as it might be correlated with the treatment variables and with each other. For example, the amount of study effort one puts in might correlate with the type of reward they are assign (e.g., a higher reward means more study efforts). On the other hand, if the reward of studying is low, a student might be more incentivized to take up part-time job, and the fact that a student has a job might lower the average number of hours they put into the study (which is measures in the variable \textit{effort}).

\subsection{(iv)} \label{q2_4}
For this question, we use a linear probabi
```{r}
drop_lm <- lm(dropout ~ bonus500 + bonus1500 + math + fyeduc + p0 + effort + job, data=dfData)
credsYear1_lm <- lm(stp2001 ~ bonus500 + bonus1500 + math + fyeduc + p0 + effort + job, data=dfData)
credsYear3_ln <- lm(stp2004 ~ bonus500 + bonus1500 + math + fyeduc + p0 + effort + job, data=dfData)

stargazer::stargazer(drop_lm,credsYear1_lm,credsYear3_ln, type = "text")
```
For this purpose, we build 3 linear probability models that include the treatment variables and all exogenous variables as the predictors. The summary shows that the effect of the financial incentive is not significant. 

\subsection{(v)} \label{q2_5}
The minimum detectable effect of this experiment is measure using the formula:

(insert latex formula)

We need to calculate the MDE for both low-reward versus control group and high-reward versus control group
```{r}
MinDE <- function(dfData, input_model, sTreatment, dAlpha, dPower){
  num_coef <- length(input_model$coefficients)
  
  # get the number of observations
  n_obs <- nrow(dfData)
  # Observations in treated group
  n_treatment <- sum(dfData[,sTreatment])
  # Proportion of treatment observations
  proportion <- n_treatment/n_obs
  
  # T_statistics of alpha and power levels
  t_stats_alpha <- qt(1-dAlpha/2, n_obs - num_coef)
  t_power <- qt(1-dPower, n_obs - num_coef)
  
  # get variance of residuals
  dVariance <- var(input_model$residuals)
  
  # get the MDE
  MDE <- (t_stats_alpha - t_power) * sqrt(1/(proportion*(1-proportion))) * sqrt(dVariance/n_obs)
  return(MDE)
}

# Initialize desired alpha and power
dAlpha = 0.05
dPower = 0.75

# Prepare dataframe
df_low_treatment = dfData[dfData$bonus1500 != 1,]
df_high_treatment = dfData[dfData$bonus500 != 1,]

#Estimate linear model with low reward treatment and control group

Low_treatment = lm(pass ~ bonus500 + math + fyeduc + p0 + effort + job, data=df_low_treatment)

#Get MDE of low-reward versus control group
MDE_low = MinDE(df_low_treatment,Low_treatment,"bonus500",dAlpha, dPower)

#Estimate linear model with high reward treatment and control group
High_treatment = lm(pass ~ bonus1500 + math + fyeduc + p0 + effort + job, data=df_high_treatment)

#Get MDE of high-reward versus control group
MDE_high = MinDE(df_high_treatment, High_treatment,"bonus1500",dAlpha, dPower)

cat("The MDE of the low reward treatment group is: ", MDE_low, "\n", ",and the MDE of the high reward treatment group is: ", MDE_high)
```


\subsection{(vi)} \label{q2_6}
An increases in the pass rate of $10\%$ points correspond with the Minimum Detectable Effect size of $10\%$. Given this, we can calculate the minimum number of observations needed using:


(insert Latex formula from lecture)

Assumptions: since we do not know n and the degree of freedom to calculate the t-stats, we assume n is big enough for a normal distribution and calculate the statictics using a standard normal distribution.

```{r}
get_n <- function(dfData, input_model, sTreatment, dAlpha, dPower, MinDE=0.1, dSigma_sq){
  # T_statistics of alpha and power levels
  t_stats_alpha <- qnorm(1-dAlpha/2, 0,dSigma_sq)
  t_power <- qnorm(1-dPower, 0, dSigma_sq)
  
  # get the number of observations
  n_obs <- nrow(dfData)
  # Observations in treated group
  n_treatment <- sum(dfData[,sTreatment])
  # Proportion of treatment observations
  proportion <- n_treatment/n_obs
  
  # get the desired sample size
  sample_size = ((t_stats_alpha-t_power)/MinDE)^2*(dSigma_sq/(proportion/(1-proportion)))
  return(round(sample_size))
}

# Initialize, set sigma and alpha fixed
dSigma_sq = 1
dAlpha= 0.5
dPower = 0.8

# required sample sizez needed in each treatment group
sample_low_required = get_n(df_low_treatment, input_model = Low_treatment,"bonus500", dAlpha = dAlpha, dPower = dPower, dSigma_sq = dSigma_sq)
sample_low_required

sample_high_required = get_n(df_high_treatment, input_model = High_treatment,"bonus1500", dAlpha = dAlpha, dPower = dPower, dSigma_sq = dSigma_sq)
sample_high_required
```


\subsection{(vii)} \label{q2_7}
Looking at the formula for MDE (page 35 of lecture slide), fewer students in the experiment mean higher MDE. If we want to achieve the same MDE with fewer students, we need to choose the proportion of control versus treatment group such that the term $p(1-p)$ is minimized. Taking the derivative of that term with respect to $p$, we find the optimal value of $p = 0.5$

in which: p is the proportion of treated students. To get $p=0.5$, we indeed need to increase number of students in control group.

Do you agree? now we need to relate this with our dataset, do some count functions, then we're done!
